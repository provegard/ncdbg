# Changelog

## 0.8.4 (2019-08-20)

* Exclude 'v8only' from printed DevTools URL to make newest Chrome/DevTools stop on breakpoints.
  Also exclude 'experiments' since I don't think it's needed. (issue #100)
* Handle script whose source name contains &lt;eval> multiple times. (issue #101)
* Log events when `handleOperation` times out, to be able to understand the error mentioned
  in issue #101.
* Support new `Debugger.enable` with arguments. (issue #106)
* Upgrade Akka to 2.5.25.

## 0.8.3 (2018-09-17)

* Better support for replaced script. If a script is reloaded with the same URL, the old script
  is "delisted." Previous behavior of creating "ndx" versions of the script has been removed.
  Using the possibility to run code from multiple versions of the same script seems like an edge
  case&mdash;it is more likely that reloading a script means that the new version should take
  effect. (Issue #98)

## 0.8.2 (2018-06-21)

* In the _ncdbg_ and _ncdbg.bat_ start scripts, add tools.jar to the class path
  even if NCDbg is built using a Java version that doesn't
  include tools.jar.
* Fix "bad substitution" error in the _ncdbg_ start script when the _sh_
  shell is Dash.
* Show the Java version that NCDbg was built with on boot. 

## 0.8.1 (2018-06-19)

* Handle arguments to Debugger.stepInto (issue #95)
* Change suspend policy to "suspend all threads." This is required to avoid JDI deadlocks
  with Java 10.
* Various changes to ensure stability given execution across multiple threads.
* Support "attach on demand" a.k.a. lazy mode. In this mode, triggered by using the `--lazy`
  command line switch, NCDbg won't connect to the debug target until DevTools connects, and
  will stay alive if the debug target dies.
* Use Gradle 4.8 for the build system. Needed for building with Java 11.

## 0.8.0 (2018-04-12)

* Don't rely on Nashorn syntax extensions in the property extractor code, since the target may
  have disabled them (issue #68)
* Pause on reference errors if pausing on exceptions.
* Detect a script added during code evaluation, e.g. when the `load` extension is used (issue #66)
* Don't capture print statements while paused, in order to avoid deadlock (issue #66)
* Try to make general pause more stable, only set breakpoints in script frames (issue #71)
* Make script contents hashing thread safe - avoids duplicate scripts with the same contents.
* Support setting a breakpoint in an unknown script (via URL or URL regexp). Emit BreakpointResolved
  when a script that matches the requested breakpoint is seen. This makes it possible to use the
  DevTools Filesystem/workspace feature.
* Ensure that changing a local variable via console code evaluation works after step/resume, i.e.
  that the new value actually remains (issue #72)
* Handle JAR URLs better. The `jar:` prefix is dropped so that embedded resources appear as
  "navigable" files in the DevTools source tree.
* Fix preview generation for typed arrays (issue #73)
* Fix console expansion of big arrays (ES6 needs to be transpiled to ES5) (issue #76)
    * Add dependency on [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler)
      for transpilation of ES6 code.
* Fix object property extraction when Java is disabled (Nashorn script engine created with `--no-java`)
  (issue #80)
* Fix VS Code connection problem, serve web sockets via /json/list also (issue #79)
* Fix VS Code locals property extraction error, handle arguments to `Runtime.callFunctionOn`
  being `null` (issue #79)
* Be friendly towards VS Code when it asks about user agent (for internal Debugger for Chrome logging)
  (issue #79)
* Serialize domain actor requests to avoid race conditions that prevent object properties from
  being fetched because the VM has resumed (issue #77)
* Fix stepping over a line where there is a breakpoint (issue #82)
* Make sure script-based property extraction happens on the correct thread (issue #78)
* Cache certain functions in Runtime.callFunctionOn. DevTools in Chrome 65.0.3325.146 introduces some
  caching but prior to that autocompletion is slow.
* Handle event request that is `null` when invoking a request-specific event handler (issue #88)
* Support Runtime.compileScript (and runScript) (issue #84)
    * This adds support for script snippets in DevTools.
    * It also enables code continuation in the console, since DevTools uses
      compileScript to detect unterminated statements.
    * Please see the documentation for limitations with compiled scripts.
* Ignore breakpoints (including `debugger` statements) when evaluating code, to prevent deadlock.
* Faster property extraction for scope objects (issues #89)
* List known bugs as console warnings when DevTools connects.
* Fix evaluation of erroneous code in `Runtime.compileScript` - always include an exception value
  (issue #90)
* Show entries for `Map` and `Set` as an internal [[Entries]] property (issue #75)
* Show proper preview for `Map` and `Set` (issue #74)
* Ignore the silent flag passed to many methods, since we ignore exceptions anyway while in
  paused mode. Always return exception details back to the caller (issue #87)
* Less verbose error message after evaluation, don't show ECMAException (issue #92)
* Don't leak hidden entries array for Map/Set to console autocompletion (issue #94)
* Fixed broken class scanning, now scanning isn't complete until all classes have been scanned,
  and yielding/resuming scan works.
* Improve class scanning speed by giving NCDbg-evaluated scripts a special source name that can
  be detected before getting the script source.
    * **NOTE**! If NCDbg is attached to a process that has been debugged with an older version,
      code eval scripts may appear in DevTools. Restarting the target process should fix that. 
* Make sure undefined variable access in artificial local scope results in ReferenceError.
* Avoid NPE in UserAccessorProperty (Nashorn) when evaluating code on global scope after
  evaluating same code on local artificial scope.
* Faster code evaluation (~50%) for Runtime.callFunctionOn, and faster construction of artificial local
  scope.
* Reuse syntax check via compileScript for subsequent code evaluation (EXPERIMENTAL).
* Ensure DevTools sees Debugger.scriptParsed for a script before compileScript returns.
* Fix bug with evaluating code inside a `with` block (issue #93)
* Make sure global object is described properly when evaluated in the console.
* List all scopes in a function [[Scopes]] internal property.

## 0.6.0 (2017-10-22)

* Lift requirement that a script path must be absolute - support relative paths as well
  (though relative source maps won't work).
* Intercept calls to Nashorn's `print` extension and send the printed message to DevTools
  as a console log message.
* Handle GC better during code evaluation (issue #62)
* Initial support for building with Java 9 (issue #67)
* Support debugging in Visual Studio Code.

## 0.5.6 (2017-09-15)

* Return internal properties (`[[Prop]]`) (issue #58):
    * `[[TargetFunction]]` for a bound function
    * `[[Scopes]]` for any function
    * `[[JavaStack]]` for a Java exception (was previously a regular property)
    * `[[Message]]` for a Java exception (was previously a regular property)
* Don't return any Java array properties if only accessors are requested.
* Merge scripts based on contents hash regardless of recompilation/original order (issue #64)
* Support script reload with changed contents and same path (issue #65)
* Scan classes in chunks to prevent locking up and preventing other operations (issue #63)

## 0.5.5 (2017-08-24)

* Remove column guessing&mdash;it's too fragile.
* Make it possible to pause in a script/function that hasn't been compiled yet (issue #61)
* Fix step-into in Java 9 (issue #60)
* When stepping out of a function, try to stay in the callee to avoid unwinding
  a long call chain.

## 0.5.4 (2017-08-14)

* Trying to make tests more stable wrt breakpoint columns.
* Return only distinct locations when setting a breakpoing.
* Parse ES6 arrow functions when guessing columns.

## 0.5.3 (2017-08-13)

* Properly pause on uncaught exceptions (issue #52)

* Implement Debugger.setSkipAllPauses (issue #48)

## 0.5.0 (2017-05-28)

* Show a java.util.Hashtable as a JS object with properties, not as a native Java
  object (issue #36).

* More robust getObjectProperties handling for ScriptObject (issue #38)
* Always return only own properties for scope objects (issue #39)
* Include the __proto__ property for JS objects (issue #40)
* Faster object properties by extracting properties in a script in the remote VM
* Faster stepping by stepping natively instead of activating one-time breakpoints
* Limited support for column numbers; on lines that contain one-liner functions, it's
  possible to set individual breakpoints (issue #35)
* When marshalling a newed JS object, use the constructor name as class name
* Handle that both scope and `this` are `null` (issue #43)

## 0.4.0 (2017-04-24)
